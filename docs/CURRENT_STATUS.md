## 📊 Verified Performance Metrics

### Test Configuration
- **Platform:** Superconducting qubit (transmon-like)
- **Hamiltonian:** H(t) = (Δ/2)σz + (Ωx(t)/2)σx + (Ωy(t)/2)σy
- **Pulse Duration:** 40 ns
- **Decoherence:** T₁ = 15 μs, T₂ = 10 μs (when enabled)
- **Training Data:** 90 pulses × 24 uncertainty samples = 2,160 simulations
- **Optimization:** Worst-case mode (conservative)

### Surrogate Model Performance
| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| R² Score | **0.9963** | Held-out test set (20%) |
| MAE | **0.0061** | Mean absolute error in fidelity |
| Training Time | ~2 minutes | On M1 MacBook Pro |

### Gate Fidelity (Optimized Pulses)

#### Test Case 1: ±2 MHz Detuning + 5% Amplitude Error
**Setup:**
- Detuning range: -2 MHz to +2 MHz
- Amplitude scale: 0.95 to 1.05
- Phase skew: ±2%
- Quasi-static noise: 0 to 0.2 MHz

**Results (from notebook validation):**
| Metric | Value | Requirement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Mean Fidelity** | **97.7%** | >95% ✅ |
| **Worst-Case Fidelity** | **95.0%** | >90% ✅ |
| **Std Dev** | **0.99%** | <2% ✅ |
| **Samples Tested** | 220 | - |

**Detuning Sweep (±2 MHz, other params nominal):**
- Min Fidelity: 95.3%
- Mean Fidelity: 97.8%
- Max Fidelity: 99.1%

#### Test Case 2: Larger Detuning Ranges (Exploratory)
**Note:** These results are from preliminary testing in the notebook. They demonstrate robustness trends but should be considered indicative rather than production-validated.

**±10 MHz Detuning:**
- Estimated mean fidelity: ~92-94% (needs formal validation)
- Worst-case: ~88-90%

**±20 MHz Detuning:**
- Framework remains stable (no optimization failures)
- Estimated mean fidelity: ~85-90% (needs formal validation)
- This demonstrates graceful degradation under extreme drift

## 🎯 Validated Use Cases

### ✅ Recommended: Conservative Calibration Drift
**Scenario:** Daily frequency drift on superconducting qubits
**Parameters:**
- Detuning: ±2 MHz (typical for transmons with flux noise)
- Amplitude errors: ±5% (typical for AWG + mixer chain)
- Pulse duration: 40 ns

**Expected Performance:** 95-98% fidelity
**Status:** **Production-ready**

### ⚠️ Experimental: Larger Frequency Drifts
**Scenario:** Uncalibrated qubits or high flux noise environments
**Parameters:**
- Detuning: ±10 to ±20 MHz
- Amplitude errors: ±5%

**Expected Performance:** 85-94% fidelity (degrades with larger drift)
**Status:** **Proof-of-concept** (needs more validation)

### ❌ Not Yet Supported
- Two-qubit entangling gates (CZ, CNOT, iSWAP)
- Non-superconducting platforms (ions, atoms, NV centers)
- Hardware-in-the-loop calibration
- Pulse duration <20 ns or >100 ns (not tested)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Platform-Specific Design
- **Issue:** DRAG pulses are optimized for superconducting qubits (leakage suppression)
- **Impact:** Not optimal for trapped ions, neutral atoms, or NV centers
- **Workaround:** Use different pulse families (planned for Phase 2)

### 2. Time Scale Constraints
- **Issue:** Optimization assumes 20-100 ns pulse durations
- **Impact:** May not converge for very short (<20 ns) or long (>100 ns) pulses
- **Workaround:** Adjust `amp_max` and `sigma_min` constraints manually

### 3. Single-Qubit Only
- **Issue:** No support for entangling gates
- **Impact:** Cannot synthesize CZ, CNOT, etc.
- **Roadmap:** Phase 3 (two-qubit gates)

### 4. Surrogate Model Extrapolation
- **Issue:** Surrogate predictions outside training distribution may be unreliable
- **Impact:** If you request ±50 MHz detuning but trained on ±2 MHz, results are unpredictable
- **Workaround:** Always train on the full uncertainty range you plan to test

### 5. No Real-Time Feedback
- **Issue:** Optimization takes 2-5 minutes per gate
- **Impact:** Not suitable for online, hardware-in-the-loop calibration
- **Roadmap:** Phase 6 (hardware integration with adaptive optimization)
